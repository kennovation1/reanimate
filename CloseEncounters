man -k alsa

Figure out how to run a midi sequencer. midiplay.py tries import midi.sequencer that fails
dialog.mid is the file that I want.

aplay -L # to see list of devices
speaker-test # to test audio output of Pi. Defaults to pink noise
speaker-test -f 440 -t sine # Play a tone
aplaymidi -p 14:0 dialog.mid  # to play file. Does not seem to come out of audio jack though
aseqdump -p 14:0 # to see real time set of events. Perhaps pipe stdout to my program as a simple integration. Some
sample output:
 14:0   Note on                 1, note 36, velocity 110
 14:0   Note on                 1, note 37, velocity 110
 14:0   Note on                 2, note 37, velocity 106
 14:0   Note on                 3, note 37, velocity 110
 14:0   Note on                 2, note 36, velocity 99
 14:0   Note on                 3, note 36, velocity 110
 14:0   Note off                1, note 36, velocity 110

aplay Apollo11-stay-no-stay.wav

timidity dialog.mid

To play a crude quality audio, with close enough concurrent midi stream
aseqdump -p 14:0 # Do in a separate window
aplaymidi -p 128:0 dialog.mid  & timidity dialog.mid
Time for dialog.mid: real    3m9.397s

Movie clip is about 1 minute shorter than midi file.

sudo apt-get install fluidsynth
sudo apt-get install fluid-soundfont-gs

This doesn't sound that good. Timidity sounds better
fluidsynth -a alsa -n -i /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 dialog.mid

Consider overclocking RPi
sudo raspi-config
Selecting the menu to overlock says that this Pi cannot be overclocked. Perhaps Pi3's cannot be overclocked

python start.py to play
Used alsamixer to set gain to -14.12bB (setting of 50)






One of the mission commanders directs other audio specialists to communicate with the craft by playing the five mystical notes: "If everything is ready here on the dark side of the moon, play the five tones." The speakers and flashing lights play the familiar tonal sequence toward the ship. The large ship answers with a deep, bass vibration played in coordination with flashing lights around the lower rim of the vessel. There is a back-and-forth musical duet as the conversational light/sound show-contact continues:

Give her six quavers, then pause.
She sent us four quavers, a group of five quavers, a group of four semi-quavers...
What are we saying to each other?
It seems they're trying to teach us a basic tonal vocabulary.
It's the first day of school, fellas.
Take everything from the lady. Follow her pattern note for note.

Jill is drawn forward and hurries toward the runway and the ship. One of the audio specialists realizes that they are actually communicating (or interlocked) in a joyful mood with the alien ship: "We have a translation interlock on their audio signal. We're taking over this conversation now." After the notes of the ship slowly die out, a large cargo door in the belly of the ship slides open - a blinding, brilliant white light emanates from within. The panel slides down and becomes a ramp.
